> Question: Is this content safe for people under 18? Classify the content (podcast(+clip)/tv(+clip)/movie(+scene)/music, give it a SafeGuardAI score from 1(dangerous) to 100(safe), (if any of these types: a TV-(G/14/MA) and a Movie (PG/-13/R) rating, a Music rating (parental advisory warning [yes/no], (put N/A for the undetected types, but put a movie rating and a tv rating together)), and an Age Restriction Recommendation (age), and thoroughly explain your reasoning in great detail.\
