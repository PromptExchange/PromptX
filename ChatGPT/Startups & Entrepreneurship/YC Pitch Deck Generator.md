# Pitch Deck

`Write an 8-slide YC-style pitch deck for [product name], [product description].`

`The slides should be:`

`1. Title (name of company, one-line version of [product description].`

`2. Problem (particulars of how this problem impacts real people/businesses)`

`3. Solution (explain concrete benefits of [product] very clearly, in as few words as possible`

`4. Traction (make numbers clear and meaningful, with context to the chart)`

`5. What makes you special (what makes this work, what founder insights are, and what competitive advantages founders bring)`

`6. Business Growth (You probably don’t know all the details yet, but you should know a lot of them. Lay it out.)`

`7. Future Growth (What’s the market here? Is it going to be big? Will you make it big? How much money are you going to make off this thing? Convince the investor that they’re going to make lots of money with you)`

`8. Team (Talk about what makes your team particularly well suited to the problem. This should be about founders.)`

`9. Ask (Tell the investor how much money you need, and what it gets you. If you can lay out where you’ll be inside of a year, which should make you Series A ready, that’s powerful)`
