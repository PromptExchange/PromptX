# Sequence Designer

What you'll need: 

[product], [ICP], [prospect role/seniority], [product description].

`Design a multi-channel automation sequence (possibly with manual email/call steps) that educates [ICP] about [product]. Design the sequence to maximize responsiveness with [prospect role/seniority] prospects.`

`List the sequence steps with their main topics, goals, and include simple bullet points for pitches at each step for [product], [product description].`
